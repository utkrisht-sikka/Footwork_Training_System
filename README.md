# Footwork_Training_System
<h2>Description</h2>
I created this project under the  guidance of our Professor Dr. Aman with the combined efforts of my teammates.It consist of a rectangular shaped ,easy to handle , elegant looking , devoid of external wiring, wooden box.Within the box we have several wires connecting 6 ldr sensors to arduino. There are 6 squares on the box. Each square has a hole.Each hole  contains an ldr. The python app displays a 2x3 grid of squares and one of them is colored pink.It indicates the next square on the wooden box on which the person is supposed to step on.  On stepping correctly, the app colors pink the next square on which the person should step. Right now there are 3 sets of sequence of foot moves hardcoded in the program.This project helped badminton players of my college master complex foot moves.
